    <h2>Caffè Mocha</h2>
    <p>
        A caffè mocha (/ˈmɒkə/ or /ˈmoʊkə/), also called mocaccino (Italian: [mokatˈtʃiːno]), is a chocolate-flavoured warm beverage that is a variant of a café latte (Italian: [kafˈfɛ lˈlatte]),[1] commonly served in a glass rather than a mug. Other commonly used spellings are mochaccino[2] and also mochachino. The name is derived from the city of Mocha, Yemen, which was one of the centres of early coffee trade.[3] Like latte, the name is commonly shortened to just mocha.
