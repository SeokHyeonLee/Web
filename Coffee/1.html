    <h2>Caffè Americano</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Americano" target="_blank" title="Caffè Americano wikipedia">Caffè Americano</a>a is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an <strong><u>espresso</u> with hot water</strong>,
        giving it a similar strength to, but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. Its strength varies with
        the number of shots of espresso and amount of water added. The name is also spelled with varying capitalization and
        use of diacritics: e.g., café americano.

    <p style="margin: top 45px;">"Americano" means "American" in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. It entered the English
        language from Italian in the 1970s. "Caffè Americano" specifically is Italian for "American coffee". There is a
        popular but unconfirmed belief that the name has its origins in World War II when American G.I.s in Italy diluted
        espresso with hot water to approximate the coffee to which they were accustomed. In his 1928 novel Ashenden: Or the
        British Agent, Somerset Maugham's protagonist orders and drinks something called an americano in Naples during World
        War I, but there is not enough information to indicate whether it is the same drink. And in Maugham's 1929 short
        story "The Wash Tub", taking place in Positano, near Naples, "americano" appears when the narrator asks "what there
        was for dinner and drank an americano, which is by no means a bad substitute for a cocktail".</p>
